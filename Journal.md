**Ayush**- After failing to make a quadruped shooter at undercity, We decided to make another one- a working one this time. I didn't start the CAD, but I was just watching a lot of videos on robotics 
and walking robots. I spent around 2 hours watching videos, and then polishing some CAD that Joel made. <br> <br>
