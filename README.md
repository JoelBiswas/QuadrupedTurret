# QuadrupedTurret
Four-legged robot with a turret mounted to the top. Created for Hack Club Highway to Undercity. <br>
A robot that can move like a spider, or a crab. It's named Rick v2, because Rick v1 was quite a failure. It uses 8 servos for movement, a 3S lipo battery for power and has 2 Servos & 2 DC Motors for it's shooter. It consists of an ESP32 wired with a perf board & jumper wires, which is controlled by a bluetooth Xbox controller.

### Breakdown of each component 
<ul>
<li> 4 Servos are use to move in the X direction and 4 other in the Y direction. <li>
<li> 1 Servo on the weapon for the weapon's rotational degree of freedom. </li>
<li> 1 Servo to reload the weapon, with a new nerf bullet </li>
<li> 1 3S Lipo 2200mAh to make run the robot for a long period of time </li>
<li> 1 ESP32 via Bluetooth connected Xbox Controller </li>
<li> Wiring will be done with a perf board and jumper wires </li>
</ul>
